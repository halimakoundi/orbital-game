Not really a game, more of a unrealistic orbit-simulator made in Elm.

The initial version was made on my flight home from #socratesUK 2016.

## How to run

Get Elm 0.17, then:

    elm package install -y
    elm-reactor

And visit <http://localhost:8000/Main.elm>.

## TODO

If I get around to it I'd like to...

* [x] Get orbits to work when more planets have gravity
* [x] Orient the planets toward the sun at all times so that the textures match
* [ ] Improve orbital physics
* [ ] Add some kind of game-play element. The idea was some kind of game where you have to figure out orbital paths when shooting to hit an object.
* [ ] Rewrite rendering in WebGL to reduce CPU usage
* [ ] Add a sun
